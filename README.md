## 📊 Dashboard Features

- **Total Accidents Over Time:** Tracks monthly/yearly trends in accident counts.
- **Accidents by State/Region:** Geographical heatmap showing accident density.
- **Top Contributing Factors:** Analysis of top causes like speeding, drunk driving, etc.
- **Accident Severity Breakdown:** Pie chart/classification based on injury/fatality.
- **Vehicle Involvement:** Insight into types of vehicles most often involved.
- **Time-Based Patterns:** Hourly/day-of-week trends for accident timing.
- **Demographic Analysis:** Age group and gender-based breakdowns (if applicable).
